# Dr. Zhang's Notes

The folder for the client is client_folder 
The PUBLIC_FOLDER in the server is the server_folder 

For edits, I want to try to not make changes to the master branch, but rather to a development branch.

# How to run

On the bottom left corner of IntelliJ, hit Terminal. Right-click on the terminal window, then hit split right.
On the server window type `java src\FtpServer.java`, and on the client window type `java src\FtpClient.java`.

## Clean up Methods

Methods are done in a very messy way. If we have time we could try 
improve readability, but it does work the way it is.

## Comment

Methods are commented, but some inline commenting should be added.
